This project is intended to solve a current issue in the real estate agent world where passing information from the agent to 
the seller is cumbersome and time consuming.  In the current world, this communication happens via phone call or text message
and there is no one place to see a summary or history of events unless it is created by the seller.

This app allows the real estate agent to populate his main screen with all of his/her listing and then populate offers and 
feedback for each home using a few clicks.  This makes it very easy to pass along information from the agent to the seller.

When a real estate agent adds a new listing, they will create seller credentials for the user to login and see the offers
and feedback that the agent adds from their mobile device or computer using the app.

The app has numerous safety protections to prevent unauthorized viewing of information.  On the front end, pages are protected
and the user cannot navigate pages unless they have the right credentials.  On the back end, the user also cannot populate 
data unless they are authorized to do us.  Having front end and backend protection may be excessive but ensures safety.
